# PricePerch

**PricePerch** is a project focused on developing a robust house price prediction model for Bengaluru using Machine Learning, Data Science, and Web Development. By analyzing factors like location, amenities, and market trends, our model provides accurate and data-driven house price predictions to counter exaggerated market prices. The project involves:

- Collecting and preprocessing data.
- Developing and validating Machine Learning models.
- Integrating these models into a user-friendly web interface.

Our goal is to offer a reliable tool for buyers, sellers, and investors, ensuring transparent and fair pricing in Bangalore's dynamic real estate market.
